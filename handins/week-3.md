- Collections



### **1.**

Write a class: *Article*

- An article has an author and a title

Create 5 articles, add them into an ArrayList and print them by overriding the *.toString()* method



<!--

### 2.

Create an interface called `FastFood` (with appropriate methods) and create a `Sandwich` class, a `Pizza` class and a class you decide that implements the `FastFood` interface.

Add some different `Fastfood` objects to an array. Now iterate through that array and use some of the methods you have created above. 



### 3.

Create a class that implements the following interface. Now create two objects using the class created

```java
interface Vehicle {
    changeGear(int a);
    speedUp(int a);
    applyBrakes(int a);
}
```

-->



### 2.

Write a class: *RedditPost*

- A Redditpost has :
  - A date of which is has been posted
  - An author
  - A balance of upvotes / downvotes
  - A Title

When a new instance of RedditPost is instantiated:

- The current date will be generated.
- The balance of upvotes and downvotes starts at 1.
- The title and author has to be provided by the constructor.



Ensure all attributes are private, but accesible by getters & setters.

Implement functionality such that redditposts can be sorted by upvotes/downvotes



### 3

Write a class: *RedditFrontPage*

The RedditFrontPage has:

- A List of all RedditPosts
- A method in RedditFrontPage deletes a RedditPost from the list, by its index number



### 4.

Write a program that takes a list of words as input and prints the frequency of each word.

- Hint: Use a MutableMap and research how it works

```kotlin
val words = listOf("apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple","banana", "apple", "orange", "banana","banana", "apple", "orange", "apple", "orange", "banana")
```



### 5.

Create a product inventory system where each product has a name and a quantity. Implement functions to add products, remove products, and display the current inventory.



### 6.

The following code has been generated by AI. **But** there are some things that can be improved. Improve the following code

```kotlin
open class Vehicle(
    var brand: String,
    var speed: Int
) {
    fun accelerate() {
        speed += 10
        println("$brand speeds up to $speed km/h")
    }

    open fun honk() {
        println("Beep!")
    }
}

class Car(
    brand: String,
    speed: Int,
    var fuelLevel: Int
) : Vehicle(brand, speed) {

    override fun honk() {
        println("$brand goes: HONK HONK!")
    }
}

class Bike(
    brand: String,
    speed: Int,
    var bellSound: String
) : Vehicle(brand, speed) {
}


// ------------ Manager ---------------

class TrafficManager {

    val vehicles: MutableList<Vehicle> = mutableListOf()

    fun register(vehicle: Vehicle) {
        vehicles.add(vehicle)
    }

    fun updateTraffic() {
        for (v in vehicles) {
            v.accelerate()

            if (v is Car) {
                v.fuelLevel -= 5
                println("${v.brand} fuel left: ${v.fuelLevel}")
            }

            if (v is Bike) {
                println("${v.brand} rings the bell: ${v.bellSound}")
            }

            if (v.speed > 120) {
                println("${v.brand} is going too fast!")
            }
        }
    }
}


// --------------- App -----------------

fun main() {
    val manager = TrafficManager()
    manager.register(Car("Toyota", 50, fuelLevel = 80))
    manager.register(Bike("Giant", 20, bellSound = "Ring ring!"))

    manager.updateTraffic()
}
```
